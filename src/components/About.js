      Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a logical problem solver, creative, out-of-the box thinker, and sci-fi enthusiast. I am naturally curious and love breaking things down into their respective parts to figure out how they work.

    <div className='about-text'>
    I am a Software Engineer and a proud IBMer currently working as a Client Engineering (formerly Garage) Cloud Engineer. Just recently, I became Red Hat Certified in Kubernetes and Containers and I'm working toward my Red Hat Specialization in OpenShift. I love playing around with web development using React and enjoy designing intuitive and aesthetic applications. At IBM, I get a chance to experiment with some cutting edge AI technology and recently built a Virtual Assistant utilizing some of IBMâ€™s best offerings.

      When I'm not programming, I love to travel, lift weights, play video games, roll dice with friends, and speculate over financial investments.
